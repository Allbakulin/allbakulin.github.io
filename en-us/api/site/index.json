    "footer_copy": "Throughout our 30 years, we have been constantly delighted by the unexpected affinities that have come from the negotiation of differences involved in establishing new stores – by means of immersion in unfamiliar landscapes, investigation of local materials, engagement with local culture and history, and of course development of fertile new relationships.\r\n\r\nOur sincere interest in intelligent and sustainable design extends to every aspect of Aesop’s workings. Just as meticulous research is integral to the formulation of each product, our utilitarian containers are carefully considered to ensure they function with ease and bring delight to our eyes. We believe unequivocally that well-considered design improves our lives.",
